# **District-Wide Standardized Test Results Analysis.** 
## Overview
This data analysis report provides insights into the relationship between school type, school budget, and student achievement for 15 high schools. 
For data analysis, two data files were merged and analyzed in a jupyter notebook [school_stats](PyCitySchools/school_stats.ipynb).
## Data Source
The data was loaded from two csv files, one is [schools_complete.csv](PyCitySchools/Resources/schools_complete.csv) which includes the following data: school id, school type, total students, and total school budget, and the other one is [students_complete.csv](PyCitySchools/Resources/students_complete.csv) which includes data per student budget, average math score, average reading score, % passing math, % passing reading, and % overall passing for 15 high schools.

Data for this dataset was generated by edX Boot Camps LLC.
